# Security Design: WAF, CORS & CSRF Protection

This document covers the security protection design in Kolya BR Proxy, including AWS WAF (rate limiting and managed rule sets at the ALB layer), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection — how these attacks work, why an API gateway must defend against them, and the specific implementation in this project.

---

## Why Does an API Gateway Need Security Protection?

Kolya BR Proxy serves two types of clients:

1. **API clients** (Cline, Cursor, OpenAI SDK) — Call `/v1/*` endpoints with Bearer Tokens
2. **Browser clients** (Vue admin dashboard) — Call `/admin/*` endpoints with JWT (Bearer Token)

This project **does not use cookie-based authentication**. The frontend stores JWTs in `localStorage` and sends them via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers. This means browsers do not automatically attach credentials, so traditional CSRF attacks (which rely on automatic cookie sending) pose a lower direct threat.

Nevertheless, this project implements full CORS and CSRF protection for the following reasons:

- **Defense in Depth** — Security should never rely on a single mechanism. If cookies are introduced in the future (e.g., HttpOnly refresh tokens), protections are already in place
- **Origin validation** blocks cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains regardless of the authentication method
- **Security response headers** prevent clickjacking, MIME sniffing, XSS, and other browser-side attacks
- **Industry best practice** — OWASP recommends these protections for all web APIs regardless of the current authentication scheme

---

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

### What Is CORS?

The browser's **Same-Origin Policy** blocks web pages from making requests to a different origin (protocol + domain + port) by default. CORS is a set of HTTP headers that allow servers to declare which external origins may access their resources.

### Why Must This Project Configure CORS?

The frontend and backend in this project run on **different origins**, a typical cross-origin architecture:

| Environment | Frontend (Admin Dashboard) | Backend (API) | Cross-Origin? |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Local dev | `http://localhost:9000` | `http://localhost:8000` | Yes (different port) |
| Production | `https://kbp.kolya.fun` | `https://api.kbp.kolya.fun` | Yes (different domain) |

Per the browser's Same-Origin Policy, if **any** of protocol, domain, or port differs, the request is cross-origin. Every request from the admin dashboard to the backend API is a cross-origin request. **If the backend does not configure a CORS allowlist, the browser blocks all API calls from the frontend, and the admin dashboard cannot function at all.**

CORS configuration is therefore a **fundamental requirement** for this project — not an optional security hardening measure, but a prerequisite for the separated frontend/backend architecture to work.

However, misconfigured CORS is equally dangerous:

- **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** — Any website can read API responses, potentially leaking sensitive data
- **Overly broad allowlists** — Attackers can leverage permitted domains to launch attacks

The correct approach is to **only allow your own frontend domain** and reject all other origins.

### Attack Scenario

```
1. Admin logs into the Kolya BR Proxy dashboard (browser holds JWT)
2. Admin opens attacker's malicious site evil.com in a new tab
3. evil.com's JavaScript sends a GET request to https://api.kbp.kolya.fun/admin/tokens
4. If CORS is configured as *, the browser allows evil.com to read the response
5. Attacker obtains the full API Token list
```

### CORS Implementation

**Configuration entry**: `backend/main.py`

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=settings.get_allowed_origins(),  # Strict allowlist
    allow_credentials=True,                         # Allow credentials
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Per-environment policy**:

| Environment | `KBR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Security Level |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Local development | `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:9000` | Relaxed (developer convenience) |
| Non-production | Non-prod domains, may include `*` for testing | Moderate |
| Production | Production domains only (e.g., `https://kbp.kolya.fun`) | Strict |

**Production validation** (`backend/app/core/config.py`):

```python
@validator("ALLOWED_ORIGINS")
def validate_allowed_origins(cls, v, values):
    env = os.getenv("KBR_ENV", "non-prod")
    debug = values.get("DEBUG", False)
    if v == "*" and env == "prod" and not debug:
        logger.error("SECURITY WARNING: ALLOWED_ORIGINS is set to '*' in production.")
    return v
```

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

### What Is CSRF?

CSRF attacks exploit the browser's automatic cookie-sending behavior to make authenticated users unknowingly submit requests to a target site. Unlike CORS, CSRF does not need to read the response — the damage is done simply by the request being executed.

### Why Can't CORS Prevent CSRF?

This is a common misconception. CORS only controls **whether the browser allows reading the response**, not whether the request is sent:

| Scenario | CORS Behavior | CSRF Risk |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Simple POST (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) | Browser sends directly, no preflight | **High** — request reaches server and executes |
| JSON POST (`Content-Type: application/json`) | Triggers preflight (OPTIONS); actual request blocked if preflight fails | **Low** — but depends on correct CORS config |
| GET request | No preflight, sent directly | Depends on whether GET has side effects |

For this project's JSON API, the CORS preflight mechanism provides some protection. But relying on CORS alone is insufficient:
- CORS policies can be misconfigured
- Browser behavior varies in edge cases
- Defense-in-depth requires multiple layers

### Attack Scenario (Assuming Cookie-Based Auth)

This project uses localStorage + Bearer Token and is not directly vulnerable to this attack. However, the following scenario illustrates why CSRF protection is critical in cookie-based systems:

```
1. User is logged into a web application (browser stores auth cookie)
2. User visits malicious page evil.com
3. evil.com submits a hidden form to the target site
   (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, no CORS preflight triggered)
4. Browser automatically attaches the cookie
5. Without CSRF protection, the request executes
6. Attacker performs a sensitive operation without the user's knowledge
```

Although this project does not use cookies, Origin validation and custom header checks still effectively restrict cross-origin request sources as an important part of defense in depth.

### CSRF Protection Implementation

**Implementation file**: `backend/app/middleware/security.py` — `SecurityMiddleware`

This project uses a **three-layer defense** strategy:

#### Layer 1: Origin Validation

For all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), verify the `Origin` header against the allowlist:

```python
if origin and not self._is_origin_allowed(origin):
    # 403 Forbidden - Origin not allowed
```

- Browsers automatically include the `Origin` header on cross-origin requests, and JavaScript cannot forge it
- Requests from unlisted origins are immediately rejected

#### Layer 2: Referer Validation (Optional)

Verify the origin in the `Referer` header is legitimate:

```python
if self.enforce_referer and not self._validate_referer(request):
    # 403 Forbidden - Invalid referer
```

- Disabled by default (`enforce_referer=False`) as some clients do not send Referer
- Can be enabled as an additional security layer

#### Layer 3: Custom Header (X-Requested-With)

Require browser requests to include either `X-Requested-With` or `Authorization`:

```python
if self.require_custom_header and origin:
    has_auth_header = request.headers.get("authorization")
    has_custom_header = request.headers.get("x-requested-with")
    if not has_auth_header and not has_custom_header:
        # 403 Forbidden - Missing CSRF protection header
```

**Why does this prevent CSRF?**

- HTML forms and `<img>` tags cannot set custom HTTP headers
- Only JavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` can add custom headers
- Cross-origin JavaScript requests trigger CORS preflight, which is blocked by the origin allowlist

**Frontend counterpart** (`frontend/src/boot/axios.ts`):

```typescript
const api = axios.create({
  headers: {
    'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',  // CSRF protection
  },
});
```

#### Exemption Rules

The following requests bypass CSRF checks:

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` methods | Safe methods that do not change server state |
| `/health/*` paths | Public health-check endpoints |
| Requests without `Origin` header | Non-browser clients (curl, SDKs) authenticated via Bearer Token |

---

## OAuth State Protection (CSRF in OAuth Login Flow)

### Why Does the OAuth Flow Need Additional CSRF Protection?

The `SecurityMiddleware` described above protects **general API requests** from CSRF. However, the OAuth login flow has a unique attack surface — the **OAuth callback endpoint**.

In the OAuth Authorization Code flow, after the user completes authentication at a third party (Microsoft / Cognito), they are redirected back to this project's callback endpoint with a `code` parameter. If an attacker can craft a malicious callback URL and trick a user into clicking it, they can:

- **Login CSRF**: Bind the victim's session to the attacker's account
- **Authorization code injection**: Replace the victim's code with one obtained by the attacker, hijacking the user's account

### Attack Scenario

```
1. Attacker initiates OAuth login and obtains a valid authorization code
2. Attacker crafts a callback URL:
   https://api.kbp.kolya.fun/admin/auth/cognito/callback?code=ATTACKER_CODE&state=...
3. Attacker tricks the victim (a logged-in admin) into clicking the link
4. Without state validation, the server accepts the attacker's code
5. The victim's browser session is bound to the attacker's OAuth identity
```

### OAuth State Implementation

**Key files**:
- `backend/app/services/oauth.py` — `OAuthService` (state generation and validation)
- `backend/app/models/oauth_state.py` — `OAuthState` (database model)
- `backend/app/api/admin/endpoints/auth.py` — Login and callback endpoints

#### Flow

```
1. User clicks login → /admin/auth/cognito/login
   │
   ├── Generate state = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)  (cryptographically secure random)
   ├── Store in database oauth_states table (with provider, expires_at)
   └── Return authorization_url (includes state parameter)

2. User completes auth at Cognito/Microsoft → redirected to callback
   │
   ├── /admin/auth/cognito/callback?code=xxx&state=yyy
   │
   ├── Validate state:
   │   ├── Database lookup: state value + provider must match
   │   ├── Expiry check: valid for 10 minutes after creation
   │   ├── One-time use: deleted from database immediately after validation
   │   └── Any check fails → 403 Forbidden
   │
   └── State validated → exchange code for token → login success
```

#### Security Properties

| Property | Implementation | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Cryptographically secure random** | `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (256 bits of entropy) | Prevent state guessing or brute force |
| **Server-side storage** | PostgreSQL `oauth_states` table | Prevent client-side tampering |
| **Provider binding** | `state` + `provider` joint validation | Prevent cross-provider replay |
| **10-minute expiry** | `expires_at = created_at + 10min` | Minimize attack time window |
| **One-time use** | Deleted immediately after successful validation | Prevent replay attacks |
| **Expired state cleanup** | `cleanup_expired_states()` periodic cleanup | Prevent database bloat |

#### Key Code

**Generate state** (`backend/app/services/oauth.py`):

```python
async def generate_state(self, provider: str) -> str:
    state = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    oauth_state = OAuthState(state=state, provider=provider)
    self.db.add(oauth_state)
    await self.db.commit()
    return state
```

**Validate state** (`backend/app/services/oauth.py`):

```python
async def validate_state(self, state: str, provider: str) -> bool:
    # Query database
    query = select(OAuthState).where(
        OAuthState.state == state, OAuthState.provider == provider
    )
    oauth_state = result.scalar_one_or_none()

    if not oauth_state or oauth_state.is_expired():
        return False

    # One-time use: delete after validation
    await self.db.delete(oauth_state)
    await self.db.commit()
    return True
```

**Callback endpoint validation** (`backend/app/api/admin/endpoints/auth.py`):

```python
# Both Microsoft and Cognito callbacks perform the same validation
if not await oauth_state_service.validate_state(state, "cognito"):
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
        detail="Invalid or expired state parameter",
    )
```

## Security Response Headers

In addition to CORS and CSRF protection, `SecurityMiddleware` adds security headers to every response:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevent browser MIME-type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevent clickjacking |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `1; mode=block` | Enable browser XSS filter |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Control Referer information leakage |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` | Restrict resource loading, prevent injection |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` | Prevent caching of sensitive data |

---

## AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

### Why WAF at the ALB Layer?

The application-layer `SecurityMiddleware` protects against CORS/CSRF attacks, but it cannot defend against volumetric abuse — high-frequency requests that overwhelm backend resources. Rate limiting at the application layer requires additional infrastructure (e.g., Redis for distributed counters) and still consumes Pod resources for every request.

AWS WAF operates at the ALB layer, intercepting malicious traffic **before it reaches EKS Pods**:

```
Client → (Optional Global Accelerator) → ALB + WAF → EKS Pod
                                           │
                                           ├── Rate limit exceeded? → 403 (blocked at ALB)
                                           ├── Known bad input? → 403 (blocked at ALB)
                                           └── Passed all rules → Forward to Pod
```

**Advantages over application-layer rate limiting:**

| Aspect | Application Layer | AWS WAF (ALB Layer) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Traffic reaches Pod | Yes — consumes CPU/memory | No — blocked before Pod |
| Distributed counting | Requires Redis or similar | Built-in (AWS-managed) |
| Managed rule sets | Manual implementation | AWS-maintained (SQLi, XSS, known bad inputs) |
| Scalability | Limited by Pod resources | Scales with ALB |

### WAF Rules

The WAF WebACL contains five rules, evaluated in priority order:

| Priority | Rule | Type | Threshold / Action | Purpose |
|----------|------|------|--------------------|---------|
| 1 | `rate-limit-auth` | Rate-based (scoped) | 20 req / 5 min per IP on `/admin/auth/*` | Prevent OAuth brute force |
| 2 | `rate-limit-chat` | Rate-based (scoped) | 300 req / 5 min per IP on `/v1/chat/completions` | Prevent API abuse |
| 3 | `aws-managed-common` | AWS Managed Rule Group | AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet | SQLi, XSS, and other common exploits |
| 4 | `aws-managed-known-bad-inputs` | AWS Managed Rule Group | AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet | Known malicious payloads (Log4j, etc.) |
| 5 | `rate-limit-global` | Rate-based (global) | 2000 req / 5 min per IP | Global abuse prevention |

**Rule evaluation logic:**

- Rules are evaluated from lowest to highest priority number
- Path-scoped rate limits (auth, chat) are checked first so they can enforce tighter limits on sensitive endpoints
- AWS Managed Rules catch known attack patterns (SQLi, XSS, Log4j, etc.) regardless of rate
- The global rate limit acts as a catch-all for any IP exceeding overall thresholds
- Default action is **Allow** — only requests matching a rule's condition are blocked

### Rate Limit Design Rationale

| Endpoint | Limit | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `/admin/auth/*` | 20 / 5 min | OAuth login involves redirects and token exchange. Legitimate users perform at most a few logins per session. A low limit effectively blocks credential-stuffing and brute-force attempts. |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | 300 / 5 min | Each chat completion request invokes a Bedrock model call (costly). 300 per 5 minutes (1 req/sec average) is sufficient for normal usage while preventing runaway scripts. |
| Global | 2000 / 5 min | Covers all endpoints including static assets, health checks, and API calls. Generous enough for legitimate browsing but blocks automated scanners and DDoS. |

### WAF Association

The WAF WebACL is associated with two ALBs (created by Kubernetes ALB Controller, discovered by name via Terraform `data "aws_lb"`):

| ALB | Default Name | Protects |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Frontend ALB | `kolya-br-proxy-frontend-alb` | Admin dashboard (`/admin/*`) |
| API ALB | `kolya-br-proxy-api-alb` | API endpoints (`/v1/*`, `/health/*`) |

### Infrastructure Configuration

**Terraform module**: `iac-612674025488-us-west-2/modules/waf/`

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `main.tf` | `aws_wafv2_web_acl` (WebACL + 5 rules) and `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` × 2 |
| `data.tf` | ALB auto-discovery by name |
| `variables.tf` | ALB names, rate limit thresholds, project metadata |
| `outputs.tf` | WebACL ARN, ID |

**Root module variables** (`iac-612674025488-us-west-2/variables.tf`):

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_waf` | bool | `true` | Enable/disable the entire WAF module |
| `waf_frontend_alb_name` | string | `kolya-br-proxy-frontend-alb` | Frontend ALB name for auto-discovery |
| `waf_api_alb_name` | string | `kolya-br-proxy-api-alb` | API ALB name for auto-discovery |
| `waf_rate_limit_global` | number | `2000` | Global rate limit (req / 5 min) |
| `waf_rate_limit_auth` | number | `20` | Auth endpoint rate limit (req / 5 min) |
| `waf_rate_limit_chat` | number | `300` | Chat endpoint rate limit (req / 5 min) |

### Monitoring

All rules have CloudWatch metrics enabled (`cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true`) and request sampling (`sampled_requests_enabled = true`). Metrics are available in the AWS WAF Console and CloudWatch under the following metric names:

- `kbr-proxy-rate-limit-auth`
- `kbr-proxy-rate-limit-chat`
- `kbr-proxy-aws-managed-common`
- `kbr-proxy-aws-managed-bad-inputs`
- `kbr-proxy-rate-limit-global`
- `kbr-proxy-waf-<workspace>` (WebACL-level default metric)
